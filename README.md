...but a taste of what's to come...

OVERVIEW & PURPOSE
- 
A visualization of restaurants and hotels within the metropolitan area of Denver, Colorado.


Instructions on how to use and interact with the project
-
We've got our data read in from the Yelp API, and then Kris stored that data in an SQL database. Using Flask, we will read information on that database and store it on a webpage. Once it is read in and hosted, we will incorporate some JavaScript and HTML (using leaflet) to create the visualizations on that webpage.


At least one paragraph summarizing efforts for ethical considerations made in the project
- 
Whether or not we display cannabis/marijuana businesses in our searches.
