...but a taste of what's to come...

OVERVIEW & PURPOSE
- 
A visualization of restaurants and hotels within the metropolitan area of Denver, Colorado.

  
Instructions on how to use and interact with the project
-
We've got our data read in from the Yelp API, and Kris got it stored in a SQL database. We're working on reading data from that database (using Flask), and once it's read in and hosted, we'll need some JavaScript and HTML (using leaflet) to handle the visualizations on a webpage  
At least one paragraph summarizing efforts for ethical considerations made in the project

Ethical Considerations
- 
Whether or not we show marijuana stores in our searches or not
